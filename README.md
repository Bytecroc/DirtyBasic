# DirtyBasic
C++ to Basic converter

This is an old project and I lost my newest version by a hard drive crash.
I make this public for all.
It is my first C++ program except some short demos I needed to learn C++.
Possibly sometimes I make a newer better one.

I programmed with Basic and Assembler for years, so I had problems with the semicolon at the end of the line.
I also found the code confusing with the curly brackets.
In the meantime I can also program C ++ directly, but I still have problems with "#include files" and the resulting errors.

With DirtyBasic I can create a project with clearly arranged files and includes.
DirtyBasic then packs everything together in a C ++ file. Only one C++ file.

I wrote the very first version directly in C ++, which cost me most of the time. 
Then I converted the project to DirtyBasic and created it with it. Each additional version created with the previous version.
Then compiled with MinGW and Orwell-Dev-C ++.
